These attacks aim to trick you into providing personal information, such as login credentials, financial details, or other sensitive data. Understanding how to detect and avoid phishing attempts is crucial for protecting yourself online.</p>

        <h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
        <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers pose as a legitimate entity to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information. These attacks can occur via email, text messages, social media, or even phone calls.</p>

        <h3>Types of Phishing Attacks</h3>
        <p>Phishing attacks come in various forms, each with its own tactics and targets:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> The most common type, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources, such as banks, companies, or even friends.</li>
          <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations. These attacks are highly personalized, making them harder to detect.</li>
          <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> A form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals, such as executives or public figures, with the goal of stealing sensitive information or funds.</li>
          <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing attempts carried out via SMS text messages, often containing malicious links or requests for personal information.</li>

          <li><strong>Spelling and Grammar Errors:</strong> Many phishing emails contain spelling and grammar mistakes, which can be a red flag.</li>
          <li><strong>Suspicious Links:</strong> Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking. Be cautious of URLs that look suspicious or unfamiliar.</li>
          <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> Avoid opening attachments from unknown or unexpected sources, as they may contain malware.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        <p>Follow these best practices to protect yourself from phishing attacks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Verify Requests:</strong> Always verify requests for sensitive information by contacting the organization directly using known contact information.</li>
