      <h2>How Often Should You Change Your Password?</h2>
      <p>Posted by CyberSecGuru on June 25, 2024</p>
      <p>I've read different opinions on how often passwords should be changed. What do you think is the best frequency for changing passwords?</p>
      <p>Changing passwords regularly is a good practice to ensure security. Here are some recommendations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Every 3-6 months:</strong> Regularly updating passwords can prevent unauthorized access if credentials are compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>After a breach:</strong> Immediately change your passwords if there is any suspicion of a breach or compromise.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical accounts:</strong> For accounts like banking or email, consider changing passwords more frequently and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).</li>
      </ul>
