      <p>Posted by TechSavvy on June 30, 2024</p>
      <p>Phishing emails are getting more sophisticated. What are some key indicators to look out for to identify phishing attempts?</p>
      <p>Recognizing phishing emails is critical to avoid falling victim to cyberattacks. Here are some signs to watch out for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Generic greetings:</strong> Phishing emails often use generic greetings like "Dear User" instead of your name.</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Beware of emails creating a sense of urgency, such as claiming your account will be locked.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspicious links:</strong> Hover over links to check their destination before clicking. Phishing links often look similar to legitimate ones but have slight variations.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsolicited attachments:</strong> Avoid opening attachments from unknown sources as they may contain malware.</li>
      </ul>
