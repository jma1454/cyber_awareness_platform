      <h2>Module 8: Incident Response Planning</h2>
      <p>This module provides a comprehensive guide to incident response planning, helping organizations prepare for and manage cybersecurity incidents.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Incident Response?</h3>
      <p>Incident response (IR) refers to the structured approach taken to manage and address the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. The goal is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.</p>

      <h3>Importance of Incident Response Planning</h3>
      <p>An effective incident response plan (IRP) is crucial for minimizing the impact of cyber incidents. It helps ensure a swift and organized response, reducing the potential damage and downtime.</p>

      <h3>Components of an Incident Response Plan</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Developing and implementing policies, procedures, and tools to respond to incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Detecting and determining whether an event qualifies as a security incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Limiting the scope and impact of the incident.</li>
        <li><strong>Eradication:</strong> Removing the cause of the incident and ensuring it does not recur.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Restoring and validating system functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Analyzing the incident to improve future response efforts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps to Develop an Incident Response Plan</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Establish an Incident Response Team (IRT):</strong> Form a dedicated team responsible for managing and responding to incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Define Roles and Responsibilities:</strong> Clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of each team member.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop Response Procedures:</strong> Create detailed procedures for each phase of the incident response process.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Detection and Analysis Tools:</strong> Use tools such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and threat intelligence to detect and analyze incidents.</li>
        <li><strong>Conduct Regular Training and Drills:</strong> Train the incident response team and conduct regular drills to ensure preparedness.</li>
        <li><strong>Review and Update the Plan:</strong> Regularly review and update the incident response plan to reflect changes in the threat landscape and organizational structure.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Best Practices for Incident Response</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain up-to-date documentation of the incident response plan and procedures.</li>
        <li>Ensure continuous communication among the incident response team, management, and other stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Leverage automation to accelerate detection, response, and recovery processes.</li>
        <li>Engage with external experts and services for additional support and expertise.</li>
        <li>Use the lessons learned from each incident to improve the incident response plan and overall security posture.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Responding to Common Types of Incidents</h3>
      <p>Guidelines for responding to specific types of incidents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware Infections:</strong> Isolate the affected systems, remove the malware, and restore from backups if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Alert users, block malicious links, and reset compromised passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Identify and contain the breach, notify affected parties, and conduct a thorough investigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Mitigate the attack using traffic filtering and rate limiting, and identify the source of the attack.</li>
      </ul>
