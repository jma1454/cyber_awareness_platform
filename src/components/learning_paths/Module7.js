      <h2>Module 7: Advanced Threat Detection</h2>
      <p>This module covers advanced techniques and tools for detecting cyber threats.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Advanced Threat Detection?</h3>
      <p>Advanced threat detection involves using sophisticated techniques and tools to identify and respond to cyber threats that evade traditional security measures. It includes monitoring, analysis, and response strategies to protect against advanced persistent threats (APTs), zero-day exploits, and other complex attacks.</p>

      <h3>Key Techniques for Advanced Threat Detection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Behavioral Analysis:</strong> Monitoring user and system behavior to detect anomalies that may indicate a threat.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Intelligence:</strong> Using information about known threats to enhance detection and response capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</strong> Monitoring endpoints (computers, servers) for suspicious activity and providing tools for investigation and response.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Traffic Analysis:</strong> Analyzing network traffic patterns to identify unusual or malicious activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Leveraging machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict potential threats.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tools for Advanced Threat Detection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):</strong> Systems that collect and analyze security events from various sources to provide real-time monitoring and alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems):</strong> Systems that detect and prevent malicious activities on a network.</li>
        <li><strong>UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics):</strong> Tools that analyze user and entity behavior to identify potential threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Intelligence Platforms:</strong> Platforms that aggregate and analyze threat intelligence data to support threat detection and response.</li>
        <li><strong>SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):</strong> Solutions that automate security operations and incident response processes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Best Practices for Implementing Advanced Threat Detection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuously update and tune detection rules and algorithms to adapt to evolving threats.</li>
        <li>Integrate threat intelligence to enhance detection capabilities.</li>
        <li>Regularly train security personnel on the latest threat detection techniques and tools.</li>
        <li>Implement a layered security approach to provide multiple lines of defense against advanced threats.</li>
        <li>Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Responding to Detected Threats</h3>
      <p>Effective response to detected threats involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Analyzing the threat to understand its nature and impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Remediation:</strong> Removing the threat and restoring affected systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Ensuring that systems are secure and operational.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Documenting the incident and reporting it to relevant stakeholders and authorities.</li>
      </ul>
